Edupepe Whitepaper v1.0

Introduction
In a world where digital innovation often focuses on profit and speculation, Edupepe emerges with a different purpose — to transform the power of memes and blockchain into a real movement for humanity. Edupepe was born from a simple yet powerful dream: to help children in orphanages and those from underprivileged families gain access to proper education, starting from Indonesia, and eventually expanding to other regions in need.

Mission & Vision
Mission: Build and repair schools in underdeveloped areas, support orphanages, and empower communities through transparency and technology.
Vision: A world where meme culture funds education — one laugh at a time.
